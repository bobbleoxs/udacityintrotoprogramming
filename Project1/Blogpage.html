          <p><b>The Desert Song — 2 June 2016</b></p>
          <p>A lady fell down into sand dunes in a desert. Before she was completely swallowed by sand she gave her last kiss to the
          wannabe king — ‘when you succeed to be a king, sing this song that will wake me and bring me back to you’ then she fell silently
          into the sand that buried her completely. The man never succeeded in becoming a king and she was never brought back.
          The heart breaking pain woke me up.</p>
          <p><b>The Valley of Flowers — years ago</b></p>
          <p>I am walking in a valley of beautiful flowers with the man I adore.</p>
          <p>‘What are these beautiful flowers?’ I asked.</p>
          <p>The man replied, ‘They are the travellers came to the valley.’</p>
          <p>‘Why are they staying here as flowers?’</p>
          <p>‘Because they forgot their names.’ he turned around and looked into my eyes, ‘and your name is…?’</p>
          <p>I forgot…</p>

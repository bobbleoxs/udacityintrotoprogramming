        <p><h4>A lady fell down into sand dunes in a desert. Before she was completely swallowed by sand she gave her last kiss to the wannabe king — ‘when you succeed to be a king, sing this song that will wake me and bring me back to you’ then she fell silently into the sand that buried her completely. The man never succeeded in becoming a king and she was never brought back. The heart breaking pain woke me up.</h4></p>

        <p><h4>I am walking in a valley of beautiful flowers with the man I adore.</h4></p>
        <p><h4>‘What are these beautiful flowers?’ I asked.</h4></p>
        <p><h4>The man replied, ‘They are the travellers came to the valley.’</h4></p>
        <p><h4>‘Why are they staying here as flowers?’</h4></p>
        <p><h4>‘Because they forgot their names.’ he turned around and looked into my eyes, ‘and your name is…?’</h4></p>
        <p><h4>I forgot…</h4></p>
